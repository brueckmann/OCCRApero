  abstractNote: The 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming specifies
    national objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
    In support of Switzerland's energy and climate strategy for 2050,
    researchers investigate scenarios for the transition of energy
    systems towards a higher share of renewables, assessing their
    social, environmental and economic impact. Their results guide
    stakeholders and policy makers in designing resilient and
    sustainable systems. Political scientists use surveys to quantify
    public acceptance of energy policy, but the complexity and long time
    horizon of the subject creates difficulties, both for researchers in
    posing contextually relevant questions, and for respondents in
    assimilating enough information to give meaningful answers. A
    population survey was therefore augmented with an online serious
    game in which players experience an accurate simulation of current
    and future energy provision and manage transition towards a
    sustainable future. This interactive environment allows better
    informed and engaged decisions, and provides richer information on
    public opinion. In this paper we motivate and describe the design of
    the game and report initial findings on player characteristics and
    engagement. We show that a serious game can successfully attract
    participants from diverse societal groups and highlight the
    challenge of balancing complexity and entertainment.
